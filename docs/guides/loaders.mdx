Some HomeflowJS components will automatically render a loader while some action is waiting to be completed (lazy-loading, waiting for a form submission etc).

The default loader consists of some animated circles. You can override this with either a React component or an HTML string:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const CustomLoader = () => (
  <div className="my-custom-loader">
    {/* Custom loader JSX */}
  </div>
);

Homeflow.set('custom_loader_component', CustomLoader);
```

OR

```jsx
const customLoaderHTML = '<div class="my-custom-loader"></div>';

Homeflow.set('custom_loader_html', customLoaderHTML);
```
