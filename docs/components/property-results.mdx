## `PropertyResults`

The `PropertyResults` component will render search results to the page.

It will render each property as one of the item components provided depending on whether the hash is `#/grid` or `#/list`. These components will receive the `property` as a prop.

You can also specify a `defaultView` prop as either 'grid', 'list' or 'map' for that view to be rendered when one of the other hashes isn't present.

```jsx
import { PropertyResults } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

<PropertyResults
  GridItem={GridItem}
  ListItem={ListItem}
  defaultView="grid"
  infiniteScroll
/>
```

### Props

- `GridItem` - Component to render for each property in `grid` view. Default is `null`.
- `ListItem` - Component to render for each property in `list` view. Default is `null`.
- `defaultView` - The default view to display when no hash is present. Default is `list`.
- `infiniteScroll` enables infinite scroll (automatically loading the next page of results when the user scrolls to the bottom of the results container). Default is `false`.
- `noMap` - pass this if you do not want the `PropertyResults` component to include a map view (in case you want to render the map separately).

#### The inserts prop

:::caution

The inserts prop is currently in alpha, therefor it does not support multiple components.

:::

- `inserts` is an array that allows you to pass a component to the `PropertyResults` component. This allows the 
`PropertyResults` component to render components such as "banners" within the results grid. The array must contain 
an object with the `component` and `frequency` keys. The `component` is what you would like to render and the `frequency` 
is how often you would like to render it, i.e you want your banner to after render every third item in the grid. 
See example bellow:

``` jsx
<PropertyResults
  GridItem={GridItem}
  defaultView="grid"
  inserts={[
    { component: <CTAImageBackgroundWithProps />, frequency: 3 }, // appears every 3 slots
  ]}
/>
```


## `LoadMoreButton`

If you wish to control pagination asynchronously using a button, you can use the `LoadMoreButton` component. It will automatically disappear once there are no more properties to render.

```jsx
import { LoadMoreButton } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

<LoadMoreButton className="load-more-button">
  Load more properties
</LoadMoreButton>
```

## `SavePropertyButton`

Button to add/remove a property from the user's saved properties.

```jsx
import { SavePropertyButton } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

<SavePropertyButton
  className="fav-link"
  propertyId={property.property_id}
  UnsavedComponent={<i className="far fa-heart" />}
  SavedComponent={<i className="fas fa-heart" />}
/>
```

### Props

- `propertyId` - The ID of the property.
- `UnsavedComponent` - component or JSX to render when the property is not currently saved.
- `SavedComponent` - component or JSX to render when the property is saved.

## `RemoveSavedPropertyButton`

A button/link to _remove_ a saved property from the user's collection. This is mainly useful for custom user profile systems where the user can manage their saved properties.

```jsx
import { RemoveSavedPropertyButton } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

// this would generally be inside a loop rendering each of the user's saved properties
<RemoveSavedPropertyButton propertyId={property.property_id}>
  Remove
</RemoveSavedPropertyButton>
```

### Props

- `propertyId` - The ID of the property.

## `SortOrderSelect`

```jsx
import { SortOrderSelect } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

<SortOrderSelect reactSelect>
  <option value="most-expensive-first">
    Price high &gt; low
  </option>
  <option value="least-expensive-first">
    Price low &gt; high
  </option>
  <option value="most-recent-first">
    Most recent first
  </option>
  <option value="most-recently-updated-first">
    Most recently updated first
  </option>
</SortOrderSelect>
```

### Props

- `reactSelect` - renders a decorated dropdown instead of a regular `<select>` if present.
- `defaultSort` - The default sort order.
