## `PropertiesResults`

The `PropertyResults` component will render search results to the page.

It will render each property as once of the item components provided depending on whether the hash is `#/grid` or `#/list`. These components will receive the `property` as a prop.

You can also specify a `defaultView` prop as either 'grid', 'list' or 'map' for that view to be rendered when one of the other hashes isn't present.

```jsx
import { PropertiesResults } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

<PropertiesResults
  GridItem={GridItem}
  ListItem={ListItem}
  defaultView="grid"
/>
```

## `LoadMoreButton`

If you wish to control pagination asynchronously using a button, you can use the `LoadMoreButton` component. It will automatically disappear once there are no more properties to render.

```jsx
import { LoadMoreButton } from 'homeflowjs/properties';

<LoadMoreButton className="load-more-button">
  Load more properties
</LoadMoreButton>
```
