## `ResponsiveImage`

If you need an image that needs to be a **[responsive image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)** and you want a react component to generate the `srcset` for this image you can use the `ResponsiveImage` component.

Its props are as follows:

| Prop            | Type    | Description                                                                   |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|src              | string  | This is the src for the image                                                 |
|alt              | string  | This is the alt attribute for your image                                      |
|srcSet           | string  | This is an optional string you can pass in if you want to add a custom srcset |
|className        | string  | This allows you to add custom styles to the component                         |


### Usage 

If you wanted an image to have the default `srcset`, 175w to 1920w you would use the component like this:

:::caution

Your `src` prop must be a string that contains `_x_`, the component will still work even if your string doesn't contain `_x_`
however it will not have a a working `srcset`.

:::

```jsx

import React from 'react';
import { ResponsiveImage } from 'homeflowjs/images';

const ExampleComponent = () => {

  const exampleImage = 'https://mr1.homeflow-assets.co.uk/files/site_asset/image/4743/3745/_x_/placeholder-house.jpg';

  return (
    <ResponsiveImage 
      className="example-class-name"
      src={exampleImage}
      alt="Example image"
     />
  )
}


```

## `replaceImageDimensions`

The `replaceImageDimensions` function allows you to replace the `_x_` with a width, height or a width and height value. It takes three arguments, src, width and height.  You can use this function when passing in your own custom `srcset` to the `ResponsiveImage` component for example:

``` jsx

import { ResponsiveImage, replaceImageDimensions } from 'homeflowjs/images';

const ExampleComponent = () => {

  const exampleImage = 'https://mr1.homeflow-assets.co.uk/files/site_asset/image/4743/3745/_x_/placeholder-house.jpg';
  const customSrcSet =
   `${replaceImageDimensions(src, 200, 200)} 200w,
    ${replaceImageDimensions(src, 400)} 400w,`;

  return (
    <ResponsiveImage 
      className="example-class-name"
      src={exampleImage}
      alt="Example image"
      srcSet={customSrcSe}
     />
  )
}

```
