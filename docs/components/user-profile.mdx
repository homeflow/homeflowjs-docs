## Default

HomeflowJS includes a default user profile modal to allow users to register, sign in, and manage their saved properties and searches.

To include it, simply pass `withDefaultUserProfile` as a prop to the `Modal` component:

```jsx
import { Modal } from 'homeflowjs';

<Modal withDefaultUserProfile />
```

This will create routes to render the below modal for any fragment identifier beginning with `#/user`.

<img alt="Default user profile" src={useBaseUrl('img/default-user-profile.png')} />

See the section on modals for more info.

If you need more flexibility in creating user profile elements, you can use the components below.
