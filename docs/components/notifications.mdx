## `notify`

To render a notification, use the `notify` function.

Pass the message as the first argument, and the type as the second. The type can be `success` or `error`.

```jsx
import { notify } from 'homeflowjs';

notify('Saved property added.', 'success');
```

### Custom Styles

You can configure the styles of the `notify` toast by making a `custom_toastify_styles` configuration object.

Begin by making this object available in your JS by using `Homeflow.set()` in a liquid template. You can then pass
your custom success / error styles into this object.

```
<script>
  Homeflow.set('custom_toastify_styles', {
      success: { background: '#0f0' },
      error: { background: '#f00' },
      className: 'custom-notify'
    });
</script>
```

See the [Configuration](getting-started/configuration.md) section for more detail on setting data this way.
