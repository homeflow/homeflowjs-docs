HomeflowJS includes its own modal system. To use it, first include en empty div on each page for modals to be rendered into:

```html
<div id="modal-container"></div>
```

Then import your modals and render them as children of the `Modal` component from `homeflowjs`. You must also provide a `path` prop that will cause them to render:

```jsx
import { withHomeflowState, Modal } from 'homeflowjs';
import ContactModal from './modals/branch-contact-modal';
import StaffContactModal from './modals/staff-contact-modal';

const Modals = () => (
  <Modal>
    <ContactModal path="/contact" />
    <StaffContactModal path="/staff-contact/:id" />
  </Modal>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  withHomeflowState(Modals),
  document.getElementById('modal-container'),
);
```

A `path` of `/staff-contact/:id` will cause the modal to be rendered when the fragment identifier (hash) is e.g. `#/staff-contact/123`. Your modal will also be passed these params (in this case `id`), which you can access inside your modal component using `props.match.params`.

If you pass the prop `withDefaultUserModal` to the `Modal` component, it will include the default user profile system and it's routes.

```jsx
<Modal withDefaultUserModal>
  <StaffContactModal path="/staff-contact/:id" />
</Modal>
```

If you intend to create your own custom user profile modal instead, omit this prop and include your modal as a child of the `Modal` component as you would any other modal. See the section on the User Profile components for more information.
