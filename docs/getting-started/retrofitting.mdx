If you are adding HomeflowJS to an existing theme you'll need to install it, as well as its peer dependencies:

```
$ yarn add homeflowjs react react-dom redux react-redux react-router-dom
```

You should then copy across the `webpack/` directory from the theme_boilerplate project here:

[Theme boilerplate Webpack directory](https://bitbucket.org/homeflow_developers/theme_boilerplate/src/d5523db6f67cb5a405494a9af4c928b5659a93f4/webpack/)

Ensure you have a `src/` directory containing an `entries/` directory.
