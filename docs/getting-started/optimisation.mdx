At Homeflow, site speed is of paramount importance to us and our clients. We recommend frequently assessing performance throughout the build process and looking for ways to optimise your code.

Here are some specific tips:

## Code-splitting

See the section on [entry points](getting-started/entry-points.mdx) on how to use code-splitting to organise your JavaScript into page-specific bundles (this is probably the most important single optimisation).

## Lazy-loading

You can use Webpack's dynamic imports to lazy-load parts of your code that are significant in size or if only required after some kind of user interaction.

If the element you intend to lazy-load is a React component, you can use [`React.lazy`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy).

```jsx
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const MyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('../my-component'));

const MyLazyComponent = (props) => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <MyComponent {...props} />
  </Suspense>
);
```

For more advanced lazy-loading of React components, you can use a library like [`react-lazyload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazyload), which has some more advanced features such as allowing you to load a component only when it is scrolled into view.

For other JavaScript code, you can use a regular [dynamic import](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#import):

```jsx
import('./math').then(math => {
  console.log(math.add(16, 26));
});
```

When Webpack compiles your code, it will automatically split the lazy import into it's own bundle and load this asynchronously when required.

## Tree-shaking

Assuming you have built your theme using the theme_boilerplate, [tree-shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) should be enabled for production builds.

Webpack will remove dead code by analyzing the `import` statements in your files.

Sometimes issues can occur when files have side-effects. You can mark a file as having side-effects by following the instructions [here](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).
